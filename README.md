# create-image-from-string

Just run *generate-image-string.py*.
When requested, type in a string (it can include uppercase/lowercase Latin alphabet letters and spaces) and the filename.
A BPM image will be generated with the message in the same folder as the *.py* file.

(The *alphabet.bpm* file contains the letters used for printing in this program. Tweak it as you wish and then change the strings
in the *letters* dictionary.)
